[Here is a link to the final project](https://manni8436.github.io/Think-Pink/)

## INITIAL DESIGN
* The initial idea behind this project is to create a website on up and coming technologies on early breast cancer screening, while raising breast cancer awareness. Target audience is anyone who wants to get information regarding breast cancer and new ways for early diagnosis and possible prevention.

## USER EXPERIENCE
The structure of the site was designed to be simple and easy to use. It has a good balance of images and content, so it does not overload the user, while giving the user
enough information on possible techonologies, how to detect possible breast cancer, also some success stories on people in tech today who have survived cancer.

* The website is for the following user types:
    * Users with no previous experience about breast cancer, and would like more information.
    * Users with basic experience about breast cancer.
    * Users who wish to get information on new prescreening technologies.

## USER STORIES

#### CLIENT GOALS
* The site needs to be easily accessible.
* The navigation menu needs to be simple to use on a range of devices, including desktops, tablets and mobiles.
* Manoeuvering around the site should be simple and straightforward.
* The site should be informative and all the text should be easy to read.
* The images should be clear and not stretched or squashed.

#### SITE USER
* I want it to be easy to understand how to navigate throughout the site.
* I want the content to be easily comprehensible.
* I want images to be clearly visible.

## DESIGN
